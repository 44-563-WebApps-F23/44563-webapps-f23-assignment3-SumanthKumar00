        <h3>Rambha Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            I like this item because i'm a Non Vegetarian. And this particular item has a blend of both Chicken and Egg.<br>
            It has the creamy textured chicken gravy as in its making they use cashews and cream mainly. And the egg is used inthe form of an Omelette.<br>
            The creamy chicken gravy is covered by an Omelette and presented with a fine garnish. This item suits well with Roti and Nan.<br>
            That creamy Chicken with a piece of Omelette combined with Nan or Roti makes a taste bomb when eaten together.
